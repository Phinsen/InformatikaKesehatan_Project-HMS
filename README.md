# InformatikaKesehatan_Project HMS
This is my college project for health informatics in which I am asked to make a Hospital Management System Web Application

To run this python project, you need to activate the virtual environment which is contained in the My_HMS folder. Here is some step by step to run the program.
1. Open your command prompt
2. Change command prompt directory into the main project folder
3. After you've changed directory into the main project folder, you can run this prompt
	"My_HMS\Scripts\activate.bat"
	This prompt will activate the python virtual environment on which this project is built
4. After activating the virtual environment, then you can move to the hospital management directory.
5. Then, you'll need to run the django project by inputing this prompt in your command prompt
	"python manage.py runserver"
	Upon running this, you'll be able to try the projects out by inserting the link shown on your command prompt which will take  you to the login page of this project.
